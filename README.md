This patch is an add-on for the Humanoid Werewolves mod.
It is designed to separate the werewolf races of players and NPCs.
The patch copies the data from WerewolfBeastRace and applies it to HNW_NPCWerewolfBeastRace,
then changes the race of all NPCs using WerewolfBeastRace to HNW_NPCWerewolfBeastRace.
